You are working inside my existing Next.js website project “MSE Magna Exim” (already running). Do NOT create a new app. Do NOT change the tech stack. Only improve UI/UX + responsiveness and update images/content as per instructions below.

1) Global Look: Reduce “90% Navy” & Improve Contrast

Keep the premium navy identity, but reduce single-color dominance.

Use a 2–3 tone layout:

Navy for header/hero overlay + premium sections

Warm light background (cream/ivory) for product cards section and spacing areas

Subtle accent colors: gold (CTAs), green (tags/pills/quality cues)

Ensure good contrast and readable typography.

2) HERO Section Fixes (Text Overlap + Empty Space)

Fix heading overlap issue completely:

Use responsive font sizing (clamp-style approach conceptually) and proper line-height so words never overlap.

Ensure the hero title/subtitle never collide on any screen size.

Address the “empty space on right side” properly:

On desktop: use a balanced 2-column hero layout (text left + hero image right) OR keep centered but ensure the layout looks intentional.

On mobile: hero becomes single-column with clean spacing.

3) HERO Image Replacement (Only Below Header Main Image)

Replace the current hero image (below header) with this file that already exists in the project:

/mnt/data/A_digital_photograph_showcases_an_assortment_of_fr.png

Make the image look premium:

Rounded corners

Subtle shadow

Correct cropping (no stretching)

Add a soft overlay if needed so text remains readable but image remains dominant.

4) “5 Banners” Showcase (Image-Dominant, Minimal Text)

Create a banner/slider section showing 5 image banners for all product groups.

The banners must be image-dominant (no heavy text blocks covering the image).

Use a small label/pill + a short title + 1 short line only (optional), placed neatly with minimal overlay.

Use arrows/dots, smooth transitions.

The 5 banners should represent:

Spices (Whole)

Spices (Powders)

Vegetables (Onions, Green chilies)

Cocoa beans

Grains (Ragi, Bajra, Jowar)

If existing banner images are weak/irrelevant, replace them with better export-grade images (from existing assets if available; if not, add new images into public/ and reference them properly).

Ensure banners look great on mobile (no text crowding, proper padding).

5) Product Category Cards: Must Be 3 Cards in One Row (Desktop)

Update the “Our Products” category cards:

Must show exactly 3 cards in one row on desktop (≥1024px).

Must NOT create a second row with empty space.

On tablet: can be 2 + 1, but the last one must be centered nicely (no awkward empty space).

On mobile: stack 1 per row with clean spacing and no misalignment.

Card titles and product coverage must match latest products:

Card 1: Spices

Dry Red chilies, Chilli powder, Turmeric rhizomes, Turmeric powder, Black pepper, Cardamom, Cinnamon

Card 2: Vegetables

Onions, Green chilies

Card 3: Grains & Cocoa

Cocoa beans, Ragi (Finger Millet), Bajra (Pearl Millets), Jowar (Sorghum)

Buttons inside each card:

Must be visually aligned and placed consistently (middle/lower-middle region), not floating differently per card.

All cards should have equal height in a row.

6) Quality Section: Two Boxes Must Be Same Height

In the “Quality Lab” (left) and “Quality Assurance Process” (right) area:

Ensure both boxes/cards become exactly the same height on desktop.

Use a layout approach where both columns stretch equally.

On mobile: stack them neatly with consistent margins.

7) Process Steps (5 Circles) Behavior Must Be Correct

Desktop/Web: all 5 steps must remain in one row (clean, evenly spaced).

Tablet/Mobile: if it becomes 2+2+1, the last item must be perfectly centered AND this behavior must apply ONLY on tablet/mobile, NOT desktop.

8) Footer: More Premium + Colored Links + One Button

Footer improvements:

Reduce plain single color block.

Add a premium gradient or texture-like subtle background.

Hyperlinks must have a distinct elegant color (gold/blue/green—choose what fits).

Add one clear footer button (e.g., “Request Quote” or “Download Catalogue”) with brand accent color.

Make spacing, alignment, and typography look polished (no “HTML document” look).

9) Mobile First: No Misalignment Anywhere

Make sure:

No horizontal scrolling on mobile.

Buttons don’t overflow.

Cards align perfectly.

Text never overlaps.

Images remain crisp and do not stretch.

10) Output Requirements

After changes:

Tell me exactly which files you edited.

Give me a short checklist confirming:

Hero overlap fixed

Hero image replaced

5 banners added and image-dominant

Product cards: 3 in one row on desktop

Equal height quality boxes

Steps correct on desktop + centered last item only on mobile/tablet

Footer improved with colored links + one button

Mobile responsiveness verified

Do the updates now and ensure the site still builds and runs successfully.
