You are working on an existing Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript website for MSE – Magna SSK Exim Solutions Pvt Ltd, a premium agri-export company.

Your task is to upgrade the hero section and its primary image so the site looks enterprise-grade, premium, export-focused, following the instructions strictly.

🚫 STRICT RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Do NOT redesign the entire website

Do NOT change existing text content

Do NOT remove or rename buttons

Do NOT introduce Tailwind, animations, or new libraries

Do NOT center-align hero text

Do NOT break mobile responsiveness

Think and act like a senior UI team with 20+ years experience

🎯 TASK 1: FIX HERO SECTION EMPTY SPACE
Current Issue

The hero section has large unused empty space on the right, making it feel unfinished and low-density.

Required Outcome

Convert hero into a two-column layout

Left column = existing text (headline, description, buttons)

Right column = premium visual panel

Layout must look balanced, intentional, and executive-grade

🎯 TASK 2: REPLACE HERO IMAGE (CRITICAL)
Problem

Current image shows only spices / dehydrated items and does not fully represent MSE’s business.

Required Image Direction

Replace the hero image with ONE strong, premium image that clearly includes:

Whole spices (turmeric, chilli, pepper, cumin, cinnamon, etc.)

Fresh vegetables (tomatoes, onions, green chilies, garlic, leafy greens)

Clean export-grade presentation (studio lighting, dark background)

Balanced composition (not cluttered, not rustic market-style)

Image MUST:

Look international and export-focused

Feel food-grade, hygienic, and premium

Avoid factory machinery visuals

Avoid plain spice-only flat lays

Avoid casual kitchen photography

This image should visually communicate:

“Spices + Vegetables + Global Exports + Quality”

🎯 TASK 3: RIGHT-SIDE VISUAL PANEL BEHAVIOR

Place the new image in the right column of the hero

Add a subtle dark overlay so it blends with the navy theme

Use rounded corners

Optionally add small trust text inside the image:
“ISO 22000 · BRCGS · FSSC 22000 · HALAL · Global Exports”

No icons required.

🎯 TASK 4: KEEP HERO CONTENT UNCHANGED

Headline text remains exactly the same

Description text remains the same

“View Products” and “Request Quote” buttons remain left-aligned

No typography changes

🎯 TASK 5: RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR

Desktop: two-column hero (text left, image right)

Mobile: stacked layout

Text first

Image below

Spacing must remain tight and premium on all screen sizes

🎯 TASK 6: VISUAL TONE & BRAND QUALITY

Hero must feel luxurious, export-oriented, and credible

Avoid flat or empty areas

Avoid overly dark monotony

Maintain brand seriousness suitable for international buyers

📂 SCOPE LIMITATION

Modify only existing hero implementation

Do NOT add new pages

Do NOT restructure folders

✅ FINAL EXPECTATION

After your changes:

No empty space remains in the hero

Image clearly shows both spices and fresh vegetables

Hero looks like it belongs to a global agri-export enterprise

UI quality reflects senior-level execution
