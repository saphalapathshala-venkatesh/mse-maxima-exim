MSE project — FINAL FIX: Switch contact-form email sending to Resend (admin + acknowledgement) with strict reliability. Make NO other UI/UX changes.

Requirements:
1) Admin lead email MUST send successfully. If it fails, return HTTP 500 and the frontend must NOT show success.
2) After admin email succeeds, send acknowledgement email to the lead (non-blocking; failures logged only).
3) Add a test endpoint POST /api/_resend-test to verify Resend quickly.
4) Update .env.example to include RESEND_API_KEY, LEADS_TO, FROM_EMAIL.
5) Keep existing form fields, success UI, and styling unchanged.

Env vars:
- RESEND_API_KEY (required)
- LEADS_TO (required) e.g. "we@magnasskexim.in" (support comma-separated list)
- FROM_EMAIL (required) e.g. "MSE Magna SSK Exim <we@magnasskexim.in>"

Implementation steps:
A) Install dependency:
- npm i resend

B) Create helper: lib/email/resend.ts
- Initialize Resend with process.env.RESEND_API_KEY
- Export sendEmail({to, subject, html, text, replyTo?})
- Use from: process.env.FROM_EMAIL
- Throw clear error if RESEND_API_KEY or FROM_EMAIL missing

C) Update the existing contact form API route (whatever route the form currently calls):
- Replace Nodemailer/SMTP with Resend helper.
- Parse the incoming fields (name, email, phone, company, product, message, etc — keep whatever exists).
- Send ADMIN email:
  to: LEADS_TO list
  subject: "New Inquiry — MSE Website"
  replyTo: lead email if present
  body: include all submitted fields in a neat HTML table + plaintext
- If admin send fails: console.error full error and return:
  status 500 JSON { ok:false, code:"EMAIL_FAILED" }

- If admin succeeds:
  - Send acknowledgement to lead email (if provided):
    subject: "We received your inquiry — MSE"
    short CTA + reassure response time + WhatsApp link https://wa.link/e854rz
  - Ack email failure must NOT block response (log only)
  - Return status 200 JSON { ok:true, code:"LEAD_SUBMITTED" }

D) Add API route: app/api/_resend-test/route.ts
- POST sends a test email to LEADS_TO using Resend
- Return 200 { ok:true, code:"SENT" } or 500 { ok:false, code:"EMAIL_FAILED" }

E) Update .env.example:
RESEND_API_KEY=
LEADS_TO=
FROM_EMAIL=

F) Verify:
- npm run build must pass
- Print exact files changed/created
- Commit message: "Use Resend for contact emails (admin + ack) + test endpoint"
