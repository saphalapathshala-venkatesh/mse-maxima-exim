You are building a premium export company website using Next.js 14+ App Router with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

PROJECT NAME: MSE Website
BRAND:
- Text logo only (NO image logo). Left aligned brand block:
  Line 1: "MSE" (large)
  Line 2: "MAGNA SSK EXIM SOLUTIONS PVT LTD" (small, letter-spaced)
- Theme must be premium exporter style, NOT plain white.

DESIGN GOAL:
- Dark premium navy textured background with vegetables + spices visuals.
- Looks like built by an enterprise agency (10 developers, 20+ years experience).
- High whitespace, clean typography, subtle premium motion only.
- NO loud gradients, NO clutter, NO random icons, NO bright colors.

TECH REQUIREMENTS:
- Next.js App Router: use /app directory.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use next/font for Google fonts:
  Headings: Playfair Display
  Body: Inter
- Use next/image for all images (with responsive sizes).
- Create reusable components: Header, Footer, Section, Card, Button.
- Ensure responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop.
- Accessibility: proper headings, contrast, alt tags, keyboard nav.

COLOR SYSTEM (must match):
- Primary Navy: #0B1B33
- Navy Alt: #102A4C
- Gold Accent: #C8A24A
- Off-white: #F5F1E8
- Muted text: #C7D2E1
- Card surface: rgba(255,255,255,0.08)
- Border: rgba(255,255,255,0.14)

BACKGROUND:
- Use a premium dark gradient navy background + subtle noise texture overlay.
- Use semi-transparent section panels (very subtle glass effect).
- Avoid plain white page backgrounds.

PAGES:
Create these routes:
1) / (Homepage)
2) /products (categories grid)
3) /products/spices
4) /products/oleoresins
5) /products/vegetables
6) /quality
7) /certifications
8) /about
9) /contact

2) Hero Section:
   - Left: Headline + short subtext about global compliance and traceability

   - Each card has "View Certificate" button (placeholder link)
7) CTA Band:

   - Copy: "Partner with a trusted exporter for your agri-product needs."
   - Button: "Request a Quote"
8) Footer:

CONTENT STYLE:
- Short, factual, exporter tone (no hype).
- Use placeholders for: countries count, capacity, addresses, emails.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- Create a global layout with consistent container width (max-w-[1200px]).
- Use generous section padding (py-20/py-24).
- Use subtle hover effects: card lift, border brighten, button glow very minimal.
- Create a clean Tailwind theme in globals.css (or tailwind config) for background + texture.
- Must be visually polished and consistent across all pages.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- DO NOT invent extra sections.
- DO NOT change theme to white.
- DO NOT add excessive icons.
- DO NOT create blog, careers, or unrelated pages.
- Keep everything minimal, premium, and export-business authentic.

Deliver complete code for all pages and components so the app runs without errors.
