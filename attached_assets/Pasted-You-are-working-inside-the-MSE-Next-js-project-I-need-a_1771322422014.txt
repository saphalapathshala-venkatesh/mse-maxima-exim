You are working inside the MSE Next.js project. I need an “Image Audit Report” and NOTHING else should be changed.

Goal:
Generate a page-wise inventory of all images used across the website, including:
1) Page/route where the image appears (e.g., /products/spices, /contact, /, etc.)
2) Component file path where it is referenced
3) Image source (local path in repo OR remote URL)
4) Exact dimensions:
   - If using next/image: capture width/height props OR "fill" usage.
   - If fill=true, capture the parent container size constraints if determinable from className (e.g., h-[380px], aspect-[...], w-full).
   - If using <img>: capture width/height attributes if present.
   - Always include “declared sizing” (props/attrs) and “CSS sizing hints” (className/style) in the report.
5) Reuse detection:
   - List images reused across multiple pages/components
   - Highlight if the same image is used with different declared sizes or different CSS sizing constraints

Implementation:
- Create a script at: scripts/image-audit.ts (or .js if TS setup is heavy)
- The script must scan these directories recursively:
  - app/ (or pages/) for route pages
  - components/
  - public/ for local image assets
- The script should parse .tsx/.ts/.jsx/.js files and detect:
  - next/image imports and <Image ... src=... />
  - <img src=... />
  - CSS background-image usage if present in JSX/style strings (best effort)
- Output:
  - A JSON report at: reports/image-audit.json
  - A human-readable Markdown report at: reports/image-audit.md
- In the Markdown report:
  - Section 1: Page-wise listing (Route → images used)
  - Section 2: Reused images summary table (Image → occurrences → sizing differences)
  - Section 3: Missing/unknown sizing notes (if width/height not found)

Constraints:
- Do NOT change any UI, pages, components behavior, styling, routing, or assets.
- Only add the script and reports folder.
- Provide a single command to run it (e.g., npm run image:audit) by updating package.json scripts ONLY (no other package changes unless absolutely required).

After implementing, run the script and confirm the report files are generated.
