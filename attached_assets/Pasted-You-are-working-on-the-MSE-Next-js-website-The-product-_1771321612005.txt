You are working on the MSE Next.js website. The product category pages under the Products dropdown are:
- /products/spices
- /products/vegetables
- /products/cocoa
- /products/millets-grains (or the existing route for Millets & Grains)

Goal: Polish UI only. No new features. Keep header/footer unchanged. Do NOT change the hero/background design (background must remain exactly as is). Do NOT change routing except to ensure the above pages use a shared hero section layout. Do NOT break existing responsiveness.

TASK (single coherent change across all 4 pages):
1) Replace the current hero text block (long paragraph) with a structured “Text Card” component on the LEFT:
   - A small badge (e.g., "EXPORT GRADE") at top
   - H1 title (category name)
   - A short 2–3 line intro
   - 5 bullet highlights (with a small check icon)
   - A small helper line: “Looking for reliable bulk export supply?”
   - Two CTA buttons (desktop inline, mobile stack):
       Primary: "Request Quote" → links to /contact?product=<slug>
       Secondary: "WhatsApp Inquiry" → links to https://wa.me/919866036606?text=<prefilled category message>
   The product slug must match the page (spices/vegetables/cocoa/millets-grains).

2) BUTTON STYLING (must match desired outcome):
   - Request Quote button must be a YELLOW/GOLD solid button with WHITE text (primary CTA).
     Use the same yellow/gold tone already used elsewhere in the site for primary actions if it exists; otherwise use a tasteful export-gold.
     Include subtle shadow and a slightly darker hover.
   - WhatsApp Inquiry button must be WHITE background with GREEN text AND a GREEN 1px border (outlined style).
     Hover state: very light green tint background OR subtle shadow (keep premium, not loud).
   - Keep button sizes consistent (same height, same border radius), and ensure accessible contrast.

3) On the RIGHT, keep the category image but make it visually match the Text Card height:
   - The image container should stretch to the same height as the card (use CSS grid/flex align-stretch).
   - The image should cover the container (object-fit: cover), with rounded corners and a subtle border/shadow consistent with the card.
   - Prevent huge empty vertical space: align top edges of card and image, and keep both vertically centered within the hero section.
   - Ensure no distortion; preserve aspect ratio with cover.

4) Layout + spacing:
   - Use a 2-column layout on desktop (left card, right image) with consistent gap.
   - On mobile, stack cleanly (keep whichever order matches the current site style), ensure no overflow, good padding.
   - Reduce perceived whitespace by tightening the hero’s internal spacing moderately (do not remove breathing room completely). Do NOT change the hero background.

5) Implementation requirement:
   - Create a reusable component (e.g., ProductHero) and a small data object for each category (title, badge, intro, bullets, image src, productSlug, whatsappText).
   - Then update all 4 pages to use this component with their own content.
   - Keep changes limited to these pages + the new shared component/styles only.
