TASK: Improve ONLY the Quality Assurance page UI/UX (route: /quality). Fix text wrapping/hyphenation issues, replace the low-quality factory image, and add small relevant images for each QA step on the right side.

STRICT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change any other pages, routes, components, or global styling unless absolutely required for text wrapping.
- Do NOT alter navbar, homepage, products pages, or contact page.
- Keep theme/colors as-is.
- Use the existing assets registry pattern (data/assets.ts) for images.
- No breaking changes.

IMAGE PLAN (add these NEW files; use these exact paths):
1) public/images/site/quality-hero-lab.jpg
   - Premium modern lab photo (professionals working, clean, corporate, bright)
   - Used in the top hero section right-side image.

2) public/images/site/qa-step-sourcing.jpg
3) public/images/site/qa-step-inspection.jpg
4) public/images/site/qa-step-processing.jpg
5) public/images/site/qa-step-labtesting.jpg
   - Small, clean, relevant images for each step, modern corporate style (no clutter, no rural sacks, no watermark).
   - These will appear on the RIGHT side of each step card/row.

ASSETS REGISTRY UPDATE:
- In data/assets.ts add:
  site.qualityHeroLab -> "/images/site/quality-hero-lab.jpg"
  site.qaStepSourcing -> "/images/site/qa-step-sourcing.jpg"
  site.qaStepInspection -> "/images/site/qa-step-inspection.jpg"
  site.qaStepProcessing -> "/images/site/qa-step-processing.jpg"
  site.qaStepLabTesting -> "/images/site/qa-step-labtesting.jpg"

PAGE UI UPDATES (ONLY /quality page code):
A) HERO SECTION (green banner):
- Keep left text and CTA "Explore Our Process" unchanged.
- Replace the current right-side image with site.qualityHeroLab.
- Remove/disable the small picture-in-picture overlay if it looks poor.
- Ensure the hero image is crisp, rounded corners, fits nicely, no grayscale, no dullness.

B) FIX TEXT WRAPPING + REMOVE HYPHENATION:
- The heading “From Source to Shipment — Quality at Every Step” must wrap cleanly with NO awkward hyphenation.
- Apply CSS (scoped to this page/section) such as:
  hyphens: none;
  word-break: normal;
  overflow-wrap: normal; (or anywhere only if needed)
  text-wrap: balance; (if supported)
- Ensure the heading wraps into 2–3 lines naturally without inserting hyphens or ugly breaks.

C) QA STEPS SECTION (Step 1–4 list):
- Current issue: right side looks empty/vague.
- Change each step row into a 2-column layout:
  LEFT: icon + step title + short 1–2 line description (rewrite text to be tighter if needed)
  RIGHT: a small engaging image relevant to the step (use the new site.qaStep* images)
- The right image must be subtle and premium (not too large), aligned center vertically, rounded corners.
- Ensure no excessive blank space remains. The row height should match content.

D) REMOVE THE FACTORY IMAGE:
- Replace the large black/white factory tanks image with a modern clean image consistent with “quality & compliance”.
- If needed reuse site.qualityHeroLab OR add ONE more optional image:
  public/images/site/quality-modern.jpg  (only if absolutely necessary)
  and register as site.qualityModern.
- Prefer not adding extra unless needed.

E) CONTENT TUNING TO AVOID BLANK SPACE:
- If any card has too much empty space, shorten bullet points or convert to 2-column bullets on desktop.
- Keep meaning same: traceability, inspection, processing control, lab testing, compliance.

DONE CHECKS:
- Only /quality page & data/assets.ts are modified (plus any new images referenced).
- Text no longer shows awkward hyphenation.
- The hero right image is premium and sharp.
- Each step has a right-side image and no odd white gaps.
- No other page changes.
