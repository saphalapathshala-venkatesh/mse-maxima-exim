You are working on my Next.js website project “MSE – Magna SSK Exim Solutions Pvt Ltd” already present in this Replit workspace. Do NOT change tech stack. Do NOT rewrite the entire UI. Make only the layout/UI fixes below, keeping the current white, clean, premium style.

Goal

Make the homepage look fancy, image-dominant, premium, with banners immediately below the header, clear separation between header and content, and perfectly aligned product cards.

A) Header → Hero separation (must be visible)

Add a thin colored divider line between the Header and the section that starts below it.

Divider should be elegant and premium (example: a 2–3px line or subtle gradient line).

It must span the container width and clearly differentiate the header from the banners.

B) Banners placement and CTA positioning

The banner/carousel section must start immediately below the header (no large empty gap).

On every banner slide:

The image must remain dominant.

Text must be minimal and should not block the image heavily.

The “Get Quote” button must be placed at the TOP RIGHT of the banner (inside the banner, not outside).

Ensure button is readable on all slides (use subtle overlay only behind the button if needed).

Keep left/right navigation arrows neat and aligned.

C) Product cards: alignment + same dimensions (critical)

On the “Products” section (Pinterest-style image cards):

All product cards must have exactly the same dimensions (same height and width within their grid).

Images should fill uniformly (use consistent aspect ratio; no awkward stretching).

Titles/subtitles must align consistently (same spacing/padding).

Ensure grid alignment is perfect:

Desktop: clean grid with equal gaps.

Tablet: balanced columns, no odd empty spaces.

Mobile: 1 column stacked neatly, no misalignment, no overflow.

Important: Remove any layout where a row looks incomplete with an “empty space” effect. The grid should always feel intentional.

D) Responsiveness rules (must test)

After implementing:

Test and ensure:

Mobile (360px / 390px): header + divider + banners + product cards look clean.

Tablet (768px / 820px): no awkward spacing or centered single leftover card.

Desktop (>=1024px): premium balanced layout.

Fix any text overlap issues and ensure no horizontal scrolling.

E) Output required

Tell me exactly which files you edited.

Summarize what you changed under each section (A, B, C, D).

If any image styles/aspect ratios were adjusted, clearly mention the rule used.

Constraints

Do not introduce new heavy libraries.

Do not redesign the whole site.

Keep the visual theme premium, bright, and image-forward.
