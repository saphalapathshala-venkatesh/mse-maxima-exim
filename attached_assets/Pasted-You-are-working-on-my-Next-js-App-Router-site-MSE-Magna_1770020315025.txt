You are working on my Next.js App Router site (MSE Magna Exim). Do NOT change the overall design theme; only fix layout/responsiveness issues listed below. Make changes only in the relevant existing files (likely app/page.tsx + globals.css or existing CSS module). Keep everything production-ready.

1) Fix HERO heading overlap (desktop + mobile)

Problem: The hero H1 text “Premium Agri-Exports with Global Compliance” is overlapping lines on Vercel.
Do this:

Make the H1 responsive using clamp-based sizing so it scales correctly across screen sizes.

Ensure line-height is safe (no overlap) and remove any negative margins or overly tight line-height.

Constrain the H1 width so it wraps naturally and does not collide with itself.

Ensure hero layout remains 2-column on desktop, stacked on mobile.

On mobile, hero title should be centered or left-aligned cleanly, with proper spacing between title, paragraph, and buttons.

Acceptance:

No overlapping text at any screen width.

Hero looks premium and balanced on desktop and mobile.

2) Replace ONLY the main hero image (below header)

Replace the hero image (right side of hero) with the local file already present in the project:
Use: /mnt/data/A_digital_photograph_showcases_an_assortment_of_fr.png (or if assets are stored in public/, move it into public/images/ and reference it properly).
Important:

Only replace this hero image; do not change other section images.

Ensure the hero image is responsive: fixed nice aspect ratio, no stretching, no cropping that cuts key objects.

Add a subtle premium overlay if needed to match theme.

3) Products section: ALL 3 cards must be in ONE row on desktop

Current issue: On desktop it becomes 2 cards + 1 card with empty space (looks like a missing 4th card).
Do this:

Force exactly 3 cards in one row on desktop (>=1024px).

On tablet, allow 2 per row if needed.

On mobile, stack 1 per row with equal spacing and no misalignment.

Ensure all product cards have equal height.

Ensure the “View Products” button is visually centered within each card (consistent alignment across cards), not randomly floating.

Acceptance:

Desktop: 3 cards in a single row always.

No “empty fourth slot” layout.

Mobile: cards are clean, aligned, no overflow or odd gaps.

4) Quality section: the two big boxes must be SAME HEIGHT

There are two side-by-side blocks:

Left: “Quality Lab” (image + text)

Right: “Quality Assurance Process” (heading + description + the 5 circle steps)
Issue: They are not equal height.
Do this:

Make the parent layout a 2-column grid on desktop where BOTH columns stretch to equal height.

Make both cards stretch to full height.

Inside each card, use flex layout so content is spaced and doesn’t collapse.

Keep the left image card looking premium and ensure image has consistent height and doesn’t distort.

Mobile: stack these two sections vertically with consistent spacing and no awkward empty space.

Acceptance:

Desktop: both boxes always equal height.

Mobile: stacked neatly, no weird gaps.

5) QA 5-circle steps: desktop MUST remain 1 row; mobile/tablet should be centered 2+2+1

You previously centered it but it affected desktop too.
Fix it correctly:

Desktop (>=1024px): keep 5 in a single row, evenly spaced.

Tablet/Mobile (<1024px): show 2 per row, then last one centered on its own row, WITHOUT changing desktop layout.

Ensure the last circle is truly centered (not leaving visible right-side empty imbalance).

Ensure no horizontal scrolling on mobile.

Acceptance:

Desktop unchanged: 1 row of 5.

Mobile/tablet: 2 + 2 + 1 (last centered), clean spacing.

6) Final checks

After changes:

Test responsive layout for widths: 1440, 1280, 1024, 768, 480, 375.

No overlaps, no horizontal scrollbars, no misaligned buttons.

Keep typography premium and spacing consistent.

Now implement these fixes carefully and only where needed. Do not introduce new libraries. Do not redesign; just correct layout, responsiveness, and image replacement.
Also tell me exactly which files you modified.

If you paste that prompt, Replit Agent should finally stop “guessing” and make the precise responsive fixes you want.
