We already have the MSE website. Perform a premium Design V2 overhaul to make it
much more appealing and agency-grade, while keeping the same content sections
(Hero, Products, Why Choose, QA Process, Certifications, CTA, Footer).

PRIMARY GOAL:
Make the site look premium and authentic, not monotonous navy, not plain, and not template-like.

DO NOT add new pages or new sections. Only upgrade visuals, layout rhythm, imagery,
button system, and component consistency.

1) MATERIAL / SURFACE SYSTEM (to remove monotony)
Implement 3 surfaces used consistently:
A) Deep Navy base (hero + footer): #0B1B33
B) Slate glass panels (content containers): rgba(255,255,255,0.07) with border rgba(255,255,255,0.12)
C) Warm Ivory “breathing” panels for short strips/dividers: #F5F1E8 with navy text

Rules:
- The whole page should NOT be the same navy background.
- Alternate sections using slate-glass panels and occasional ivory strips.
- Keep it premium: no bright colors, no loud gradients.

2) HERO SECTION — must look cinematic and premium
Replace the current hero visual approach with:
- Left: headline + subheadline + two CTAs
- Right: a premium image collage (2 stacked cards or 1 large + 1 small overlay):
  - spices image
  - vegetables image
  - optional facility image as a faint background layer
Add a subtle gold accent line under the headline.

Hero background:
- deep navy gradient + subtle noise (very light)
- soft spotlight behind headline (radial gradient)

3) IMAGE QUALITY (major upgrade)
The first image under header must be replaced with a premium “hero transition” banner:
- full width, short height
- high quality spices + vegetables close-up
- add overlay gradient so it blends with navy theme

Replace the QA section image (the black/white tanks) with a clean QA-related image:
- lab testing / inspection / hygienic processing
- integrate as a card inside the QA section (not floating alone).

IMPORTANT:
Use local images inside /public/images so they never break.
Create these placeholder local assets (if not present):
/public/images/hero-spices.jpg
/public/images/hero-vegetables.jpg
/public/images/banner-spices-veg.jpg
/public/images/qa-lab.jpg
/public/images/facility.jpg
/public/images/spices.jpg
/public/images/oleoresins.jpg
/public/images/vegetables.jpg

If you can't fetch real photos, use temporary placeholders but ensure the layout is premium and images never show empty.

4) SECTION RHYTHM (remove empty gaps)
Adopt consistent spacing:
- Hero: pt-24 pb-16
- Banner image section: py-10
- Main content sections: py-16
- CTA strip: py-18
- Footer: pt-16 pb-10
Remove any large empty navy space between sections. Each section should visually connect.

5) BUTTON SYSTEM (glossy + premium, consistent everywhere)
Create a reusable Button component with variants:
- primary (glossy gold)
- secondary (glass outline)
- subtle (ivory on navy when needed)

Primary glossy gold:
- gradient: #D1AE57 -> #B8892E
- text: #0B1B33
- soft shadow + slight lift hover
Secondary glass:
- background rgba(255,255,255,0.06)
- border 1px solid rgba(200,162,74,0.55)
- text #F5F1E8

Replace ALL text-link CTAs:
- View Products
- View Certificate
- Request Quote
- Download Catalogue
must be real buttons, same sizing, aligned, no arrow-only CTAs.

6) PRODUCTS SECTION — fix alignment + premium cards
- Make 3 product cards equal height using flex:
  card: flex flex-col
  content: flex-1
  CTA: mt-auto
- Ensure all buttons align perfectly.
- Improve card visuals:
  - image top with subtle overlay
  - glass panel body
  - border + hover lift
  - add small category tag pill (e.g., “Export Grade”) in muted gold outline

7) QA PROCESS — put circles inside a premium panel
- Remove the horizontal line.
- Wrap all 5 steps in one rounded rectangle container (panel):
  - background: rgba(255,255,255,0.06)
  - border: rgba(255,255,255,0.12)
  - padding: large
- Each step circle uses icon + small number under icon
Icons (Lucide outline):
1 Sourcing: Sprout
2 Processing: Factory
3 Testing: ShieldCheck
4 Packaging: Package
5 Global Logistics: Globe
Each circle gets unique muted color ring (one circle one color):
#6F8F72, #4F8FA8, #C8A24A, #7A7FA8, #5C7C99

8) CERTIFICATIONS — fix buttons + card discipline
- Certification cards must be equal height.
- Button anchored at bottom, centered.
- Change button styling to “secondary glass” (not primary gold).
- Add a small certification badge area at top of card to look authentic (e.g., “Certified” pill).

9) FOOTER — make it premium, not monotonous
- Footer stays deep navy but add a warm ivory top strip divider (thin).
- Use a 3-column grid with better spacing.
- Add a compact “Request Quote” CTA in footer (secondary button).
- Improve typography hierarchy.

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Keep Playfair Display for headings
- Inter for body
- Improve readability: consistent line-heights, reduce overly large empty lines.

DELIVERABLE:
Return updated code with:
- refined global styles/tokens
- updated sections, spacing, images, buttons
- consistent premium material contrast
- no empty broken images
- aligned CTAs and cards
- overall “agency-grade” polish
