We already have the MSE website running. Now improve the UI to feel more premium and consistent.

GOAL:
- Make the UI more appealing and premium.
- Replace ALL CTA text links with glossy button CTAs.
- Fix broken "MSE processing facility" image (it is currently empty / not loading).
- Ensure consistency across product cards, certifications cards, and hero CTAs.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
1) Replace these everywhere:
   - "View Products →"
   - "View All Products →"
   - "View Certificate →"
   with glossy CTA buttons (no arrow-only CTAs).
   CTA text must be full, e.g. "View Products", "Request Quote", "View Certificate".
   Arrows are allowed only as a small icon inside the button (optional), not as the label.

2) Create a reusable Button component:
   - variants: primary, secondary
   - sizes: md, lg
   - default rounded-xl
   - subtle lift on hover, and premium glossy effect

PRIMARY BUTTON (gold glossy):
- background: gradient from #D1AE57 to #B8892E
- top highlight: subtle inset white overlay
- text: #0B1B33 (navy)
- shadow: soft
- hover: slightly brighter + translateY(-1px)

SECONDARY BUTTON (navy glass outline):
- background: rgba(255,255,255,0.06)
- border: 1px solid rgba(200,162,74,0.55)
- text: #F5F1E8
- hover: background rgba(255,255,255,0.10)

3) Fix missing "processing facility" image:
- Put 3 placeholder images inside /public/images/:
  /public/images/hero-spices.jpg
  /public/images/hero-vegetables.jpg
  /public/images/facility.jpg
  /public/images/spices.jpg
  /public/images/oleoresins.jpg
  /public/images/vegetables.jpg
- If you cannot fetch real images, use simple local placeholders (but must not break).
- Update next/image usage to reference these local public images.

4) Improve Product Cards:
- Keep the same layout but make cards feel premium:
  - glass panel background rgba(255,255,255,0.08)
  - subtle border rgba(255,255,255,0.14)
  - hover: border brighten + shadow + small lift
  - card image should be full width on top with slight dark overlay
  - add a glossy CTA button inside each card: "View Products"

5) Improve Certifications cards:
- Keep grid, but each certification card must have a glossy "View Certificate" button.
- Ensure consistent spacing, alignment, and button placement.
- Do NOT use arrow-only CTAs.

6) Keep theme and typography:
- Primary Navy background and texture stays.
- Headings: Playfair Display
- Body: Inter
- No new sections. Only UI polish and fixes.

DELIVERABLE:
- Provide updated code with the reusable Button component and refactor all CTAs to use it.
- Ensure the facility image no longer shows empty/broken.
- Site should look more premium and consistent.
