We have an existing MSE website. Apply the following premium corrections:

A) IMAGES — replace low-quality / wrong-context images
1) Replace the main banner image below header with a premium export-style spice flatlay:
   - spices in bowls, peppercorns, turmeric, cinnamon, star anise
   - dark wood or slate background
   - no branded jars, no random packaging
2) Replace Oleoresins product image:
   - must look like food-industry extracts/oleoresins, not cosmetics/spa
   - use lab glassware or amber food-extract bottles on industrial clean background

IMPORTANT: Use local images stored in /public/images/ so nothing breaks.
Create these filenames and use them:
- /public/images/banner-spices-export.jpg
- /public/images/spices.jpg
- /public/images/oleoresins.jpg
- /public/images/vegetables.jpg
If real images cannot be fetched, use decent placeholders but keep the look consistent and premium.

B) CONTRAST — reduce navy dominance
The website currently looks 90% navy; introduce premium contrast:
1) Keep deep navy background mainly for hero and major navy sections.
2) Convert the Products section background to Warm Ivory (#F5F1E8) with navy text (#0B1B33).
   - Product cards should become navy/slate panels sitting on ivory background.
3) Convert Certifications section background to Warm Ivory (#F5F1E8) with navy text,
   while keeping certification cards as refined navy/slate panels.
4) Add thin gold divider lines (#C8A24A) between major sections (subtle, not loud).

C) CERTIFICATIONS — switch from 5 to 4 cards + fix buttons
1) Show ONLY 4 certification cards in grid (responsive: 1/2/4 columns):
   - ISO 22000
   - BRCGS
   - FSSC 22000
   - HALAL
2) Move "FSSAI" into a small line of text below the grid (not as a card).
3) Fix View Certificate buttons:
   - Each card must be `flex flex-col`
   - The content area must be `flex-1`
   - The button must be `mt-auto`
   - Button must not wrap, must be consistent size/shape
   - Button style: secondary premium (glass navy) with subtle gold border
   - Option: make button full width in the card for perfect consistency.

D) FOOTER — make it premium, not HTML
1) Footer must feel like an intentional brand section:
   - Deep navy background with subtle gradient
   - Add a warm ivory divider strip on top (thin)
   - Improve typography hierarchy and spacing
   - Use a clean 3-column layout with headings
   - Add a small CTA button "Request Quote" inside footer (secondary style)
   - Include social links only if needed; avoid clutter.

E) KEEP THE BRAND
- Keep fonts (Playfair for headings, Inter for body)
- Keep primary navy and gold accents
- No new sections/pages; only redesign the affected sections for premium contrast.

DELIVERABLE:
Update code so:
- Images look premium and relevant
- Products + Certifications are on ivory background (strong contrast)
- Certifications grid is 4 cards with perfect buttons
- Footer looks like premium brand block
- Overall site feels more varied and agency-built.
