Refine the existing MSE website to achieve a true enterprise-grade,
agency-built (10 developers, 20+ years experience) look.

GOAL:
- Improve visual hierarchy, cohesion, and premium feel.
- Remove dead spaces, fix misalignments, add material contrast.
- Make the site feel authentic, export-industry credible, and polished.

MANDATORY CHANGES:

1) HERO TRANSITION IMAGE
- Replace the first image below the header with a cinematic, eye-catching image:
  - spices + vegetables on dark surface
  - full width, short height
  - subtle dark overlay + vignette
- This image must act as a visual divider, not a standalone section.

2) SECTION SPACING SYSTEM
- Reduce excessive vertical gaps.
- Use consistent rhythm:
  - Hero: pt-28 pb-20
  - Transition images: py-10
  - Content sections: py-16
  - CTA sections: py-20
  - Footer: pt-20 pb-12
- No large empty navy areas between sections.

3) PRODUCT CARDS ALIGNMENT
- Make product cards equal height using flex layout.
- Structure cards as:
  - flex flex-col
  - content area flex-1
  - CTA button mt-auto
- Ensure all "View Products" buttons align perfectly across cards.

4) QUALITY ASSURANCE IMAGE
- Replace the current disconnected black-and-white facility image.
- Use a clean, premium image related to:
  - quality testing
  - lab inspection
  - hygienic processing
- Integrate the image into the QA section (side-by-side or soft background),
  so it visually supports the process.

5) QA PROCESS PANEL
- Remove the horizontal connecting line.
- Wrap all 5 process circles inside a single rounded rectangular container:
  - calm slate/navy background (lighter than base)
  - subtle inner shadow
  - generous padding
- Circles sit cleanly inside this panel, not floating on the page.

6) CERTIFICATION BUTTONS & ALIGNMENT
- Change "View Certificate" buttons to a refined secondary style:
  - glass navy background
  - soft gold border
  - white text
- Ensure:
  - equal card heights
  - button anchored at bottom
  - consistent button size and alignment

7) MATERIAL & COLOR VARIATION
- Reduce monotony by introducing surface contrast:
  - Deep navy: hero, footer
  - Slate / blue-grey panels: products, QA, certifications
  - Occasional soft off-white micro sections for breathing
- Add subtle gradients and grain textures (very light).
- Do NOT introduce bright colors or clutter.

STRICT RULES:
- Do not add new sections.
- Do not remove existing content.
- Do not change brand colors drastically.
- Focus on cohesion, alignment, and material quality.

DELIVERABLE:
- Updated code with refined spacing, aligned components,
  cohesive QA section, premium imagery, and reduced monotony.
- The site should look intentionally designed, not assembled.
