You are working inside my existing Next.js app in this Replit workspace.

TASK: Create an “Image Audit Report” so I can upload the right images without any mismatch later.

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT change any UI, styling, layout, routes, or text.
- Do NOT rename or delete any images.
- Do NOT modify page components unless absolutely required to read paths (prefer read-only analysis).
- Only read files and generate a report.

WHAT TO DO:
1) Identify the “single source of truth” for image paths:
   - Check if we use data/assets.ts (or similar). If yes, treat it as the registry.
   - If any page still uses hardcoded /images/... paths, list them separately.

2) Produce a PAGE-WISE report with this structure:
   - Page Route: /
     - Component(s) that render images (ex: HeroCarousel, CategoryCards, etc.)
     - Image usage list:
       - Purpose (Hero banner / Section image / Card image / Thumbnail etc.)
       - Registry key (if from assets.ts) OR literal path (if hardcoded)
       - Final public path (ex: public/images/banners/hero-spices.jpg)
       - File exists? (YES/NO)
       - Recommended size/aspect ratio (based on how it’s rendered: 16:9 hero, square card, etc.)
   Repeat for:
   - /quality
   - /certifications
   - /about
   - /contact
   - /products/spices
   - /products/vegetables
   - /products/cocoa
   - /products/grains
   - /product/[slug] (product detail page)
   - Any other routes present in app/

3) Also output a FOLDER INVENTORY:
   - List all files under public/images/** grouped by:
     banners/, categories/, products/, site/
   - Mark any duplicates (same-looking purpose but multiple filenames) and any unused files (present on disk but not referenced anywhere).

4) Finally, create a clean “UPLOAD CHECKLIST”:
   - A table of required filenames per folder (exact filenames), and which page(s) will break if missing.

DELIVERABLE:
- Print the report in the chat output.
- If needed, save it as docs/IMAGE_AUDIT.md in the repo (this is allowed and does not change UI).
