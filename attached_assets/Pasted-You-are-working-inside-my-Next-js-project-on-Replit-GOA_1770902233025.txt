You are working inside my Next.js project on Replit.

GOAL:
Clean up image assets so there are NO duplicates and NO naming mismatches.
Each visual slot must have exactly ONE image file. The site must not break.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT change layout/styling/UI. Only assets + references.
- Do NOT delete any image until you confirm it is NOT referenced anywhere.
- All image references must be controlled from a single registry file (data/assets.ts). No hardcoded /images paths in components.
- After cleanup, the app must run with no 404 image requests for the required slots.

CURRENT FOLDERS (must exist):
public/images/banners/
public/images/products/
public/images/site/
(Optional: public/images/categories/ ONLY if already used in registry)

TASKS:

1) INVENTORY
- List all files under public/images/** (recursive) with paths.
- Search entire codebase for "/images/" references and list them.

2) SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (REGISTRY)
- Ensure data/assets.ts exists and is the ONLY place that defines image paths.
- Update all components/pages to import from data/assets.ts.
- After this step, there must be ZERO hardcoded "/images/" references outside data/assets.ts.

3) CANONICAL NAMING (LOCKED STANDARD)
Use exactly these canonical filenames:
BANNERS (homepage slider):
- hero-spices.jpg
- hero-vegetables.jpg
- hero-cocoa.jpg
- hero-grains.jpg
- hero-quality.jpg

CATEGORY (category header images):
- spices.jpg
- vegetables.jpg
- cocoa.jpg
- grains.jpg
- oleoresins.jpg (only if used)

SITE (about/quality/facility):
- facility.jpg
- quality-lab.png

PRODUCTS (13 items) under public/images/products/:
- dry-red-chilli.jpg
- chilli-powder.jpg
- turmeric-rhizomes.jpg
- turmeric-powder.jpg
- black-pepper.jpg
- cardamom.jpg
- cinnamon.jpg
- cocoa-beans.jpg
- onions.jpg
- green-chillies.jpg
- ragi.jpg
- bajra.jpg
- jowar.jpg

4) DEDUPLICATION PLAN (SAFE)
For every existing non-canonical image (like export-*.png, banner-*.png, hero-transition.png, etc):
- Decide if it maps to one of the canonical slots above.
- If yes: KEEP the best-quality file and RENAME it to the canonical filename (same folder).
- If no: mark it as "unused candidate".

5) REFERENCE UPDATE
- Update data/assets.ts to use ONLY canonical filenames (with correct folders).
- Ensure pages/components show the correct images using registry.

6) SAFE DELETE
- After updating registry, re-scan project for references to any "unused candidate".
- ONLY delete files that have ZERO references.
- Keep a short "deleted files list" in replit.md.

7) VERIFY
- Run the dev server and confirm:
  - App loads
  - No broken images
  - No 404s for images
  - No console errors due to missing files

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- Final folder tree under public/images/ with ONLY canonical files
- Confirmed statement: "No hardcoded /images paths exist outside data/assets.ts"
- List of renamed files (old -> new)
- List of deleted files
- Any remaining missing files (if some canonical slots have no image yet)

Proceed carefully and do NOT break the site.
