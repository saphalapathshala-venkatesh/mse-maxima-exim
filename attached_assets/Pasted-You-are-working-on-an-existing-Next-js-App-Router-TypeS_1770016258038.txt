You are working on an existing Next.js App Router + TypeScript site for MSE – Magna SSK Exim Solutions Pvt Ltd.

The previous attempt failed because the hero image did not actually change and the site is not fully polished on mobile. Fix both now.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

Do NOT redesign the entire site

Do NOT change existing hero text content

Do NOT remove/rename CTAs (“View Products”, “Request Quote”)

Do NOT add Tailwind or new UI libraries

Keep premium enterprise look

Must look excellent on mobile + desktop

PART A — FORCE THE HERO IMAGE TO CHANGE (NO EXCUSES)
Step A1: Identify the TRUE hero image source

Search the project for where the hero image is coming from:

Look for <img ...>, <Image ...>, background-image: url(...), heroImage, hero.jpg, spices, banner, etc.

The hero may be implemented in app/page.tsx, a dedicated component (Hero.tsx), or in CSS.

You must update the actual source being used.

Step A2: Replace hero image with a new LOCAL file

Do not rely on random remote URLs.

Create a folder: public/images/

Add a new hero image file name:
public/images/hero-spices-vegetables.jpg

If you cannot fetch an image automatically, create a temporary placeholder file and leave a clear TODO note asking the user to upload the image into that exact path — but still update code to use this filename.

Step A3: Ensure old image cannot appear

Remove any duplicate hero image references

If hero uses CSS background-image, replace it with the new local path.

Make sure there is exactly ONE hero image in the hero section.

Ensure the app is not referencing the previous spice-only image anywhere in the hero.

Step A4: Make the hero image premium + blended

Use a subtle dark overlay/gradient so text area matches the navy theme.

Rounded corners, high quality presentation.

Image must visually represent:
spices + fresh vegetables + export-grade cleanliness
(tomatoes/onions/green chilies/garlic/leafy greens + turmeric/chilli/pepper/cumin etc.)

PART B — MOBILE-FIRST POLISH (CRITICAL)
Current issue

Site looks okay on desktop, but not great on mobile.

Required fixes

Header

Logo + menu icon should not overlap

Add proper padding on mobile

Keep nav accessible and not cramped

Hero section

Desktop: two-column (text left, image right)

Mobile: stacked:

text first

CTAs next

image last

Reduce huge empty areas: tighten spacing

Headline should wrap nicely and not look oversized

Buttons

Ensure buttons are not cut off on small screens

Keep CTA buttons aligned and same width on mobile (or stacked)

Maintain glossy premium styling

Products cards

On mobile: 1 card per row with consistent padding

CTA buttons should appear centered inside each card and aligned consistently

Certifications section

Reduce to 4 cards (not 5)

Ensure equal height, equal padding, and button alignment

“View Certificate” buttons must be inside the card, not floating oddly

Footer

Must not look like a plain HTML block

Add contrast and premium styling:

slightly lighter panel background than main navy

proper spacing

colored links (subtle accent)

add ONE CTA button in footer (ex: “Request Quote”) with premium styling

Mobile footer should stack neatly and remain readable

PART C — VERIFICATION (DO THIS BEFORE FINISHING)

After making changes, verify:

Hero image shown is hero-spices-vegetables.jpg

No old spice-only hero image appears

Mobile layout (375px width) looks premium:

no overlaps

no cut text

no weird gaps

buttons visible and tappable

Desktop still looks premium

OUTPUT REQUIRED

Implement the changes directly in the project files and ensure the site looks premium and fully responsive.
