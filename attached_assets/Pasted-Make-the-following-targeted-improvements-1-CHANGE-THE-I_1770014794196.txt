Make the following targeted improvements:

1) CHANGE THE IMAGE (below the hero CTAs / View Products area)
- Replace the current image collage (spice jars + berries) with ONE premium export-style banner image.
- The image must convey bulk export spices (unbranded), e.g. spices in bowls/sacks on dark wood/slate.
- Remove any irrelevant fruits/berries visuals.
- Add the image locally as: /public/images/export-bulk-spices.jpg
- Update the code to use this single image (no collage), with rounded corners and a soft shadow.
- Add a subtle dark overlay gradient on the image so it matches the premium navy theme.

2) FOOTER PREMIUM UPGRADE — reduce plain single color look
- Footer currently looks flat/monotonous. Redesign it into a premium 3-layer footer:

A) TOP DIVIDER STRIP
- Add a thin full-width divider above footer (8–12px tall) in warm ivory (#F5F1E8) or subtle gold line (#C8A24A).

B) FOOTER BODY
- Use a deep navy gradient background (not flat):
  from #07162C to #0B1B33 (subtle).
- Add very subtle texture/noise effect using CSS (low opacity).
- Improve spacing and hierarchy:
  headings brighter, links slightly muted, better line-height.

C) FOOTER CTA BUTTON
- Add a colored CTA button in footer (e.g. “Request Quote”):
  Use glossy gold gradient (#D1AE57 → #B8892E),
  text color #0B1B33,
  hover lift + shadow.

3) FOOTER LINKS — add color + premium hover
- Make footer hyperlinks visually distinct:
  default: soft ivory text (rgba(245,241,232,0.85))
  hover: gold (#C8A24A)
- Underline should appear on hover only.
- Optional: for the main navigation links only (Quality/Certifications/About/Contact), allow a subtle teal hover (#4F8FA8) if it looks premium; do NOT use many colors.

4) FOOTER BOTTOM BAR
- Add a bottom bar strip with slightly darker navy (#061225) for copyright and policy links.
- Policy links should follow the same hover color system.

RULES:
- Do not change footer content meaning.
- Only improve visual styling, CTA addition, and link colors.
- Keep it premium and consistent with the rest of the site.
