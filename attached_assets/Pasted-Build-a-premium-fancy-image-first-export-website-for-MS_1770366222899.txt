Build a premium, fancy, image-first export website for MSE (Magna SSK Exim Solutions Pvt Ltd) using Next.js App Router (TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS. The site must be white-background, bright, modern, “international exporter” feel. Remove navy as primary. Use a clean product-first layout with Pinterest-style images and a rotating banner carousel.

0) Hard requirements

App Router only: /app directory (no pages router)

Tailwind CSS only (no CSS modules unless absolutely needed)

Fully responsive: mobile-first, no overflow, no misalignment, no overlapping text

Performance: images lazy-load, banners optimized, avoid huge page weight

Use only local assets in /public (no external image URLs)

Ensure next/image is used for all images

1) Color + UI direction (NO navy)

White / light theme, fancy and bright.
Use this palette:

Background: #FFFFFF

Light surface: #EEF1F4

Primary accent (green): #2D6A4F

CTA accent (saffron): #E09F3E

Text: #343A40

Optional highlight: #C0392B (chili red) only for small accents

Design style:

Spacious, premium

Product images dominate (Pinterest-like)

Buttons rounded, subtle shadows, smooth hover transitions

2) Pages (routes)

Create these routes:

/ Home

/products (same grid but with filters and all products)

/contact dedicated contact page with full form

3) Home page sections (in this order)
A) Header (sticky)

Left: MSE logo/wordmark

Right: nav links: Products, Quality, Certifications, About, Contact

CTA buttons: “Request Quote” (primary saffron), “Download Catalogue” (outline)

Mobile: hamburger menu opens drawer; CTA buttons stack neatly (no overlap)

B) Hero (white background)

Large headline + subtext (no overlap on any screen)

One big hero image to the right on desktop, below text on mobile

Add 2 CTAs: “View Products” + “Request Quote”

Must not leave awkward empty space; layout must adapt:

Desktop: 2-column

Tablet: balanced

Mobile: stacked with proper spacing

C) Featured Product Banner Carousel (5 banners)

This is the “fancy” section.

A carousel with 5 slides, each slide is a large banner image with minimal text overlay (image remains dominant).

Slide content includes:

Tag badge (e.g., “EXPORT GRADE”)

Product name

Short one-liner

CTA button: “Get Quote”

Add left/right arrows + dots

Must be touch-friendly on mobile (swipe)

Text overlay must never dominate image; keep it small and readable

Banners should represent:

Spices (Whole)

Spices (Powders)

Vegetables (Fresh)

Cocoa Beans

Millets/Grains

D) “All Products” Section (Pinterest grid, all items separately)

IMPORTANT: Home page must list every product item as its own tile (not grouped).
Products list (each must be its own product card):

Dry Red Chilies

Chilli Powder

Turmeric Rhizomes

Turmeric Powder

Black Pepper

Cardamom

Cinnamon

Cocoa Beans

Onions

Green Chilies

Ragi (Finger Millet)

Bajra (Pearl Millets)

Jowar (Sorghum)

Grid behavior:

Desktop: 4 columns masonry/pinterest feel (variable heights allowed)

Tablet: 2–3 columns

Mobile: 1 column (or 2 if space allows), perfectly aligned, no odd gaps

Each tile shows: image + product name + short caption

Hover (desktop): subtle zoom + shadow

Tap (mobile): opens product quote modal (see section 4)

E) Trust / Certifications strip

Show icons and short points: Traceability, Export Standards, Quality Testing, Global Logistics

Clean light background block

F) Footer (white/light, premium)

Columns: Products, Company, Contact

Colored link styling (green accent), hover saffron underline

Add one colored CTA button “Request a Quote”

Include address, email, phone

Bottom line copyright

4) Quote flow (must work from banners AND product tiles)

When user clicks “Get Quote” on a banner OR clicks any product tile:
Open a modal drawer (center modal on desktop, bottom-sheet on mobile) showing:

Product name (pre-filled)

Quantity dropdown options: 10 KG, 25 KG, 50 KG, 100 KG, Custom

If Custom: show number input in KG

“Price per KG” displayed (use placeholder values for now but structure must exist)

Auto-calculated total amount displayed live

Button: “Get Quote” (primary saffron)

On clicking “Get Quote” inside modal:
Open the contact form modal (or step 2 in same modal) asking:

Name

Company

Email

Phone

Country

Delivery Port/City

Product (pre-filled)

Quantity (pre-filled)

Message/Requirements

Submit button

On submit:

Show success confirmation (no backend needed now)

Also provide a “Contact Page” link in footer and header that opens /contact page with same form

5) Assets (images)

Create /public/images/ and add placeholder images for:

5 banner images (high quality, bright, product-dominant)

12 product tile images (one per product)
Use meaningful filenames like:
banner-spices-whole.jpg, product-turmeric-rhizomes.jpg, etc.
If exact images are not available, generate clean placeholders or use consistent local placeholder images — but keep structure ready to replace later.

6) Animations (light but fancy)

Use subtle scroll reveal on sections (fade/slide)

Product tiles hover zoom

Carousel slide transition smooth

Modal open/close smooth
Keep it premium (no excessive motion)

7) QA checklist you must satisfy before finishing

No text overlap anywhere (especially hero and banner)

Mobile view: no empty spaces, no misalignment

Carousel works with arrows + dots + swipe

Product grid shows ALL items separately

Quote modal works end-to-end with auto calculation

Footer links are colored and CTA button exists

Lighthouse-friendly: avoid huge images; lazy load

Deliverable:

Update project files accordingly

Explain where to replace images in /public/images/

Provide exact run steps and confirm responsive behavior
